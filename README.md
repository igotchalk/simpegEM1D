simpegEM1D
==========

simpegEM1D is a geophysical simulation and inversion software for an electromagnetic (EM) geophysical surveys. 
Here we assumed that the earth conductivity struture is layered. Each of layers can have different physical properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and dieletric constant. Particularly it is designed to handle inducitve loop source with a single receiver coil or magnetometer. A main interest of the package is hanndling airborne EM survey, which can quickly map electrical conductivity of the subsurface at large area. This package is under ecosystem of an opensource geophysical simulation and inversion software, SimPEG, and hence installation of SimPEG is required.
